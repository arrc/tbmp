# the bookmark project (tbmp) - DEAD PROJECT
## though most of the features were implemented and functional.
The idea was to build a full featured cloud bookmarking app with tags, categories,
 site groups etc with iPhone application (swift) and browser extension (Safari, Chrome, Firefox).  

### Features implemented
- Token authentication (JWT).
- Save bookmarks via extension.
- Tags and Topics.
- iPhone application (can only view saved bookmarks list & login/register.)

 It even had a fully functional [chrome extension](https://github.com/arrc/tbmp-chrome-extension)

### Future
 The legacy will continue with [Bloi.co](https://github.com/arrc/bloi.co)
